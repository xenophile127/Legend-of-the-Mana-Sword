Palettes for Vampire.

Background colors are the same as pal/00, except the flash palettes.

Vampire uses the first two reserved palettes--obj5 and obj6, plus the third (obj7) is used for its explosion effect.

The projectile palette is for its bats, dark purple with yellow eyes.

The boss damage flash effect is a washed-out version of the colors, but with the red less desaturated.

Fuji is expected to be present for this battle so obj3 is given her palette.

The script flash effect is changed to a red effect. This is used at the beginning and end of the fight.

It is possible to reach Vampire with the Blind effect active so the boss reserved palettes are set with a red outline. This is sort of an easter-egg as the timing window for seeing this is pretty narrow..
