Palette for Jackal. 

Background colors are the same as pal/00.

Only the first background palette is populated, the rest are monochrome and unused.

Two boss palettes are loaded--obj5 and obj6.

The boss damage flash effect is is a washed-out version of the colors. Close to but not quite white.

The explosion effect--obj4--is currently set to some of the same colors Jackal uses.
