Palette for Golem.

Background colors are the same as pal/00.

Only the first background palette is populated, the rest are monochrome and unused.

Golem shares sprite frame structures with Jackal, which includes what palettes are asigned to what areas.

Two boss palettes are loaded--obj5 and obj6, but they are both identical.

The boss damage flash effect is is a washed-out version of the colors. Close to but not quite white.

The explosion effect--obj4--is currently set to some brown colors.
