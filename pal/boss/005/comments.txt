Palette for Golem.

Background colors are the same as pal/00.

All three boss palettes are used--obj5, obj6, and obj7.

Golem and Jackal share a lot of data internally. One quadrant of Golem uses a different palette that is set to the same colors. That palette is used to give Jackal extra detail.

Golem uses an overlay metasprite to give it an eye using different colors.

obj5 - The "base" colors. Three quarters of Golem use this palette.
obj6 - Set identical to obj6. It covers one of Golem shoulders.
obj7 - The overlay sprite. It is positioned centered at the top of Golem's sprite. Used for an eye. Three colors are available but only two are currently used.

The boss damage flash effect is is a washed-out version of the colors. Close to but not quite white.

The explosion effect--obj4--is currently set to some brown colors.
