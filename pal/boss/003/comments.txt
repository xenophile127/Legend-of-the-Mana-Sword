Palettes for Megapede.

Background colors are the same as pal/00.

Megapede uses the first reserved palette--obj5--for its head, and the second--obj6--for its body segments.

The projectile palette is used for its death explosion. It is set to its head palette with the dark color changed to a red..

Watts is expected to be present for this battle so obj3 is given the proper palette.

The boss damage flash effect has the head (the only vulnerable spot) use very washed out shades of its colors--close to but not quite white. The tail segments lighten but only a very small amount.
