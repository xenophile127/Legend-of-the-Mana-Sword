Palettes for Hydra.

Background colors are the same as pal/00.

Two boss palettes are loaded--obj5 and obj6.

The boss damage flash effect is a washed-out version of the colors. Close to but not quite white.

The fireballs and explosion effect--obj4--are currently set the same as obj5.

The Traveler may be present for this battle so obj3 is given his palette.

The boss script flash effect has been changed to not quite blacken the background colors of bgp0 and to use a slightly greenish white for the bgp0 black. The boss' flash its self isn't actually changed.
